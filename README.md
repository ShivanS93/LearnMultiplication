# LearnMultplication.py Readme
## Introduction
Made in April 16th, 2020 by Shivan Sivakumaran. The one and only version.

This is my <b>very first</b> python project.

The reason for making this is to quiz myself on muliplication.
## How it works
You can either run `LearnMultplication.py` or run the `LearnMulplication.bat` file.

Running the .py file will prompt how many 'tests' to play and the range of times tables. Once the game is completed programme will exit. This is all done on command line by the way. No fancy GUI.

If you run the .bat file, it should call the .py file. The extra caveat is that you are asked to play again instead of exiting at the end.
## Dependancy
I wrote this on Python 3.7 standard library. So no other installations should be needed.
## Feedback
Any feedback is welcomed.
